{"id": "SEED_0", "title": "Attentive Convolution: Equipping CNNs with RNN-style Attention Mechanisms", "abstract": "In NLP, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have benefited less than recurrent neural networks (RNNs) from attention mechanisms. We hypothesize that this is because the attention in CNNs has been mainly implemented as attentive pooling (i.e., it is applied to pooling) rather than as attentive convolution (i.e., it is integrated into convolution). Convolution is the differentiator of CNNs in that it can powerfully model the higher-level representation of a word by taking into account its local fixed-size context in the input text t^x. In this work, we propose an attentive convolution network, ATTCONV. It extends the context scope of the convolution operation, deriving higher-level features for a word not only from local context, but also information extracted from nonlocal context by the attention mechanism commonly used in RNNs. This nonlocal context can come (i) from parts of the input text t^x that are distant or (ii) from extra (i.e., external) contexts t^y. Experiments on sentence modeling with zero-context (sentiment analysis), single-context (textual entailment) and multiple-context (claim verification) demonstrate the effectiveness of ATTCONV in sentence representation learning with the incorporation of context. In particular, attentive convolution outperforms attentive pooling and is a strong competitor to popular attentive RNNs."}

Despite their success, the high complexity of the attention mechanism hinders them from being applied to latency-sensitive tasks. Tremendous efforts have been made to alleviate this problem, and many of them successfully reduce the asymptotic complexity to linear. Nevertheless, most of them fail to achieve practical speedup over the original full attention under moderate sequence lengths and are unfriendly to finetuning. In this paper, we present DFSS, an attention mechanism that dynamically prunes the full attention weight matrix to N:M fine-grained structured sparse pattern. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that demonstrates DFSS is a good approximation of the full attention mechanism. We propose a dedicated CUDA kernel design that completely eliminates the dynamic pruning overhead and achieves speedups under arbitrary sequence length. We evaluate the 1:2 and 2:4 sparsity under different configurations and achieve 1.27~ 1.89x speedups over the full-attention mechanism. It only takes a couple of finetuning epochs from the pretrained model to achieve on par accuracy with full attention mechanism on tasks from various domains under different sequence lengths from 384 to 4096."}

However, the underlying reasons for their strong performance have not been well explained. In this paper, we bridge the gap by assessing the strengths of selective SANs (SSANs), which are implemented with a flexible and universal Gumbel-Softmax. Experimental results on several representative NLP tasks, including natural language inference, semantic role labelling, and machine translation, show that SSANs consistently outperform the standard SANs. Through well-designed probing experiments, we empirically validate that the improvement of SSANs can be attributed in part to mitigating two commonly-cited weaknesses of SANs: word order encoding and structure modeling. Specifically, the selective mechanism improves SANs by paying more attention to content words that contribute to the meaning of the sentence. The code and data are released at https://github.com/xwgeng/SSAN."}

However, since existing positional encoding schemes have been initially designed for NLP tasks, their suitability for vision tasks, which typically exhibit different structural properties in their data, is questionable. We argue that existing positional encoding schemes are suboptimal for 3D vision tasks, as they do not respect their underlying 3D geometric structure. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a geometry-aware attention mechanism that encodes the geometric structure of tokens as relative transformation determined by the geometric relationship between queries and key-value pairs. By evaluating on multiple novel view synthesis (NVS) datasets in the sparse wide-baseline multi-view setting, we show that our attention, called Geometric Transform Attention (GTA), improves learning efficiency and performance of state-of-the-art transformer-based NVS models without any additional learned parameters and only minor computational overhead."}
{"id": "SEED_4", "title": "Improving the Faithfulness of Attention-based Explanations with Task-specific Information for Text Classification", "abstract": "Neural network architectures in natural language processing often use attention mechanisms to produce probability distributions over input token representations. Attention has empirically been demonstrated to improve performance in various tasks, while its weights have been extensively used as explanations for model predictions. Recent studies (Jain and Wallace, 2019; Serrano and Smith, 2019; Wiegreffe and Pinter, 2019) have showed that it cannot generally be considered as a faithful explanation (Jacovi and Goldberg, 2020) across encoders and tasks. In this paper, we seek to improve the faithfulness of attention-based explanations for text classification. We achieve this by proposing a new family of Task-Scaling (TaSc) mechanisms that learn task-specific non-contextualised information to scale the original attention weights. Evaluation tests for explanation faithfulness, show that the three proposed variants of TaSc improve attention-based explanations across two attention mechanisms, five encoders and five text classification datasets without sacrificing predictive performance. Finally, we demonstrate that TaSc consistently provides more faithful attention-based explanations compared to three widely-used interpretability techniques."}

In addition to improving performance of models, attention has been widely used as a glimpse into the inner workings of NLP models. The latter aspect has in the recent years become a common topic of discussion, most notably in work of Jain and Wallace, 2019; Wiegreffe and Pinter, 2019. With the shortcomings of using attention weights as a tool of transparency revealed, the attention mechanism has been stuck in a limbo without concrete proof when and whether it can be used as an explanation. In this paper, we provide an explanation as to why attention has seen rightful critique when used with recurrent networks in sequence classification tasks. We propose a remedy to these issues in the form of a word level objective and our findings give credibility for attention to provide faithful interpretations of recurrent models."}

Self-attention is currently widely used, however interpretability is difficult due to the numerous attention distributions. Recent work has shown that model representations can benefit from label-specific information, while facilitating interpretation of predictions. We introduce the Label Attention Layer: a new form of self-attention where attention heads represent labels. We test our novel layer by running constituency and dependency parsing experiments and show our new model obtains new state-of-the-art results for both tasks on both the Penn Treebank (PTB) and Chinese Treebank. Additionally, our model requires fewer self-attention layers compared to existing work. Finally, we find that the Label Attention heads learn relations between syntactic categories and show pathways to analyze errors."}

They however suffer from a prohibitive limitation due to the self-attention mechanism, inducing $O(n^2)$ complexity with regard to sequence length. To answer this limitation we introduce the LSG architecture which relies on Local, Sparse and Global attention. We show that LSG attention is fast, efficient and competitive in classification and summarization tasks on long documents. Interestingly, it can also be used to adapt existing pretrained models to efficiently extrapolate to longer sequences with no additional training. Along with the introduction of the LSG attention mechanism, we propose tools to train new models and adapt existing ones based on this mechanism."}
{"id": "SEED_8", "title": "Temporal Attention for Language Models", "abstract": "Pretrained language models based on the transformer architecture have shown great success in NLP. Textual training data often comes from the web and is thus tagged with time-specific information, but most language models ignore this information. They are trained on the textual data alone, limiting their ability to generalize temporally. In this work, we extend the key component of the transformer architecture, i.e., the self-attention mechanism, and propose temporal attention - a time-aware self-attention mechanism. Temporal attention can be applied to any transformer model and requires the input texts to be accompanied with their relevant time points. It allows the transformer to capture this temporal information and create time-specific contextualized word representations. We leverage these representations for the task of semantic change detection; we apply our proposed mechanism to BERT and experiment on three datasets in different languages (English, German, and Latin) that also vary in time, size, and genre. Our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on all the datasets."}

We add a third view and show that such models can be viewed as attention-driven models. This new perspective enables us to empirically and theoretically compare the underlying mechanisms to that of the self-attention layers in transformers and allows us to peer inside the inner workings of the Mamba model with explainability methods. Our code is publicly available."}
{"id": "SEED_10", "title": "The Topological BERT: Transforming Attention into Topology for Natural Language Processing", "abstract": "In recent years, the introduction of the Transformer models sparked a revolution in natural language processing (NLP). BERT was one of the first text encoders using only the attention mechanism without any recurrent parts to achieve state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks.   This paper introduces a text classifier using topological data analysis. We use BERT's attention maps transformed into attention graphs as the only input to that classifier. The model can solve tasks such as distinguishing spam from ham messages, recognizing whether a sentence is grammatically correct, or evaluating a movie review as negative or positive. It performs comparably to the BERT baseline and outperforms it on some tasks.   Additionally, we propose a new method to reduce the number of BERT's attention heads considered by the topological classifier, which allows us to prune the number of heads from 144 down to as few as ten with no reduction in performance. Our work also shows that the topological model displays higher robustness against adversarial attacks than the original BERT model, which is maintained during the pruning process. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to confront topological-based models with adversarial attacks in the context of NLP."}

On four different corpora we demonstrate that our hybrid TSM duration predictions are highly correlated with human gaze ground truth. We further propose a novel joint modeling approach to integrate TSM predictions into the attention layer of a network designed for a specific upstream NLP task without the need for any task-specific human gaze data. We demonstrate that our joint model outperforms the state of the art in paraphrase generation on the Quora Question Pairs corpus by more than 10% in BLEU-4 and achieves state of the art performance for sentence compression on the challenging Google Sentence Compression corpus. As such, our work introduces a practical approach for bridging between data-driven and cognitive models and demonstrates a new way to integrate human gaze-guided neural attention into NLP tasks."}
{"id": "SEED_12", "title": "Transformer Acceleration with Dynamic Sparse Attention", "abstract": "Transformers are the mainstream of NLP applications and are becoming increasingly popular in other domains such as Computer Vision. Despite the improvements in model quality, the enormous computation costs make Transformers difficult at deployment, especially when the sequence length is large in emerging applications. Processing attention mechanism as the essential component of Transformer is the bottleneck of execution due to the quadratic complexity. Prior art explores sparse patterns in attention to support long sequence modeling, but those pieces of work are on static or fixed patterns. We demonstrate that the sparse patterns are dynamic, depending on input sequences. Thus, we propose the Dynamic Sparse Attention (DSA) that can efficiently exploit the dynamic sparsity in the attention of Transformers. Compared with other methods, our approach can achieve better trade-offs between accuracy and model complexity. Moving forward, we identify challenges and provide solutions to implement DSA on existing hardware (GPUs) and specialized hardware in order to achieve practical speedup and efficiency improvements for Transformer execution."}

However, the ability of the attention heads to judge the grammatical acceptability of a sentence has been underexplored. This paper approaches the paradigm of acceptability judgments with topological data analysis (TDA), showing that the geometric properties of the attention graph can be efficiently exploited for two standard practices in linguistics: binary judgments and linguistic minimal pairs. Topological features enhance the BERT-based acceptability classifier scores by $8$%-$24$% on CoLA in three languages (English, Italian, and Swedish). By revealing the topological discrepancy between attention maps of minimal pairs, we achieve the human-level performance on the BLiMP benchmark, outperforming nine statistical and Transformer LM baselines. At the same time, TDA provides the foundation for analyzing the linguistic functions of attention heads and interpreting the correspondence between the graph features and grammatical phenomena."}
{"id": "SEED_14", "title": "Attention Can Reflect Syntactic Structure (If You Let It)", "abstract": "Since the popularization of the Transformer as a general-purpose feature encoder for NLP, many studies have attempted to decode linguistic structure from its novel multi-head attention mechanism. However, much of such work focused almost exclusively on English -- a language with rigid word order and a lack of inflectional morphology. In this study, we present decoding experiments for multilingual BERT across 18 languages in order to test the generalizability of the claim that dependency syntax is reflected in attention patterns. We show that full trees can be decoded above baseline accuracy from single attention heads, and that individual relations are often tracked by the same heads across languages. Furthermore, in an attempt to address recent debates about the status of attention as an explanatory mechanism, we experiment with fine-tuning mBERT on a supervised parsing objective while freezing different series of parameters. Interestingly, in steering the objective to learn explicit linguistic structure, we find much of the same structure represented in the resulting attention patterns, with interesting differences with respect to which parameters are frozen."}

However, their effectiveness is often compromised by inherent bias, leading to prompt brittleness, i.e., sensitivity to design settings such as example selection, order, and prompt formatting. Previous studies have addressed LLM bias through external adjustment of model outputs, but the internal mechanisms that lead to such bias remain unexplored. Our work delves into these mechanisms, particularly investigating how feedforward neural networks (FFNs) and attention heads result in the bias of LLMs. By Interpreting the contribution of individual FFN vectors and attention heads, we identify the biased LLM components that skew LLMs' prediction toward specific labels. To mitigate these biases, we introduce UniBias, an inference-only method that effectively identifies and eliminates biased FFN vectors and attention heads. Extensive experiments across 12 NLP datasets demonstrate that UniBias significantly enhances ICL performance and alleviates prompt brittleness of LLMs."}
{"id": "SEED_16", "title": "SparseBERT: Rethinking the Importance Analysis in Self-attention", "abstract": "Transformer-based models are popularly used in natural language processing (NLP). Its core component, self-attention, has aroused widespread interest. To understand the self-attention mechanism, a direct method is to visualize the attention map of a pre-trained model. Based on the patterns observed, a series of efficient Transformers with different sparse attention masks have been proposed. From a theoretical perspective, universal approximability of Transformer-based models is also recently proved. However, the above understanding and analysis of self-attention is based on a pre-trained model. To rethink the importance analysis in self-attention, we study the significance of different positions in attention matrix during pre-training. A surprising result is that diagonal elements in the attention map are the least important compared with other attention positions. We provide a proof showing that these diagonal elements can indeed be removed without deteriorating model performance. Furthermore, we propose a Differentiable Attention Mask (DAM) algorithm, which further guides the design of the SparseBERT. Extensive experiments verify our interesting findings and illustrate the effect of the proposed algorithm."}

The goal is to map an input string to an output string, where the strings may be of different lengths and have characters taken from different alphabets. Recent approaches have used sequence-to-sequence models with an attention mechanism to learn which parts of the input string the model should focus on during the generation of the output string. Both soft attention and hard monotonic attention have been used, but hard non-monotonic attention has only been used in other sequence modeling tasks such as image captioning (Xu et al., 2015), and has required a stochastic approximation to compute the gradient. In this work, we introduce an exact, polynomial-time algorithm for marginalizing over the exponential number of non-monotonic alignments between two strings, showing that hard attention models can be viewed as neural reparameterizations of the classical IBM Model 1. We compare soft and hard non-monotonic attention experimentally and find that the exact algorithm significantly improves performance over the stochastic approximation and outperforms soft attention.

{"id": "SEED_18", "title": "Video Captioning with Text-based Dynamic Attention and Step-by-Step Learning", "abstract": "Automatically describing video content with natural language has been attracting much attention in CV and NLP communities. Most existing methods predict one word at a time, and by feeding the last generated word back as input at the next time, while the other generated words are not fully exploited. Furthermore, traditional methods optimize the model using all the training samples in each epoch without considering their learning situations, which leads to a lot of unnecessary training and can not target the difficult samples. To address these issues, we propose a text-based dynamic attention model named TDAM, which imposes a dynamic attention mechanism on all the generated words with the motivation to improve the context semantic information and enhance the overall control of the whole sentence. Moreover, the text-based dynamic attention mechanism and the visual attention mechanism are linked together to focus on the important words. They can benefit from each other during training. Accordingly, the model is trained through two steps: \"starting from scratch\" and \"checking for gaps\". The former uses all the samples to optimize the model, while the latter only trains for samples with poor control. Experimental results on the popular datasets MSVD and MSR-VTT demonstrate that our non-ensemble model outperforms the state-of-the-art video captioning benchmarks."}
{"id": "SEED_19", "title": "SEAT: Stable and Explainable Attention", "abstract": "Currently, attention mechanism becomes a standard fixture in most state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models, not only due to outstanding performance it could gain, but also due to plausible innate explanation for the behaviors of neural architectures it provides, which is notoriously difficult to analyze. However, recent studies show that attention is unstable against randomness and perturbations during training or testing, such as random seeds and slight perturbation of embedding vectors, which impedes it from becoming a faithful explanation tool. Thus, a natural question is whether we can find some substitute of the current attention which is more stable and could keep the most important characteristics on explanation and prediction of attention. In this paper, to resolve the problem, we provide a first rigorous definition of such alternate namely SEAT (Stable and Explainable Attention). Specifically, a SEAT should has the following three properties: (1) Its prediction distribution is enforced to be close to the distribution based on the vanilla attention; (2) Its top-k indices have large overlaps with those of the vanilla attention; (3) It is robust w.r.t perturbations, i.e., any slight perturbation on SEAT will not change the prediction distribution too much, which implicitly indicates that it is stable to randomness and perturbations. Finally, through intensive experiments on various datasets, we compare our SEAT with other baseline methods using RNN, BiLSTM and BERT architectures via six different evaluation metrics for model interpretation, stability and accuracy. Results show that SEAT is more stable against different perturbations and randomness while also keeps the explainability of attention, which indicates it is a more faithful explanation. Moreover, compared with vanilla attention, there is almost no utility (accuracy) degradation for SEAT."}

From recent work, we know that there is sparsity in transformers and that the floating-points within its computation can be discretized to fewer values with minimal loss to task accuracies. However, this requires retraining or even creating entirely new models, both of which can be expensive and carbon-emitting. Focused on optimizations that do not require training, we systematically study the full range of typical attention values necessary. This informs the design of an inference-time quantization technique using both pruning and log-scaled mapping which produces only a few (e.g. $2^3$) unique values. Over the tasks of question answering and sentiment analysis, we find nearly 80% of attention values can be pruned to zeros with minimal ($< 1.0\\%$) relative loss in accuracy. We use this pruning technique in conjunction with quantizing the attention values to only a 3-bit format, without retraining, resulting in only a 0.8% accuracy reduction on question answering with fine-tuned RoBERTa."}

However, conventional self-attention mechanisms are originally designed for modeling textual sequence without considering the characteristics of speech and speaker modeling. Besides, different Transformer variants for speaker recognition have not been well studied. In this work, we propose a novel multi-view self-attention mechanism and present an empirical study of different Transformer variants with or without the proposed attention mechanism for speaker recognition. Specifically, to balance the capabilities of capturing global dependencies and modeling the locality, we propose a multi-view self-attention mechanism for speaker Transformer, in which different attention heads can attend to different ranges of the receptive field. Furthermore, we introduce and compare five Transformer variants with different network architectures, embedding locations, and pooling methods to learn speaker embeddings. Experimental results on the VoxCeleb1 and VoxCeleb2 datasets show that the proposed multi-view self-attention mechanism achieves improvement in the performance of speaker recognition, and the proposed speaker Transformer network attains excellent results compared with state-of-the-art models."}

The efficacy of self-attention in speech applications, however, seems not fully blown yet since it is challenging to handle highly correlated speech frames in the context of self-attention. In this paper we propose a new neural network model architecture, namely multi-stream self-attention, to address the issue thus make the self-attention mechanism more effective for speech recognition. The proposed model architecture consists of parallel streams of self-attention encoders, and each stream has layers of 1D convolutions with dilated kernels whose dilation rates are unique given stream, followed by a self-attention layer. The self-attention mechanism in each stream pays attention to only one resolution of input speech frames and the attentive computation can be more efficient. In a later stage, outputs from all the streams are concatenated then linearly projected to the final embedding. By stacking the proposed multi-stream self-attention encoder blocks and rescoring the resultant lattices with neural network language models, we achieve the word error rate of 2.2% on the test-clean dataset of the LibriSpeech corpus, the best number reported thus far on the dataset."}

Specifically, we devise a pooling mechanism to align the character-level attention to the word level and propose to alleviate the potential issue of segmentation error propagation by multi-source information fusion. As a result, word and character information are explicitly integrated at the fine-tuning procedure. Experimental results on five Chinese NLP benchmark tasks demonstrate that our model could bring another significant gain over several pre-trained models."}

However, it is not clear if the self-attention network could be a good alternative of RNNs in automatic speech recognition (ASR), which processes the longer speech sequences and may have online recognition requirements. In this paper, we present a RNN-free end-to-end model: self-attention aligner (SAA), which applies the self-attention networks to a simplified recurrent neural aligner (RNA) framework. We also propose a chunk-hopping mechanism, which enables the SAA model to encode on segmented frame chunks one after another to support online recognition. Experiments on two Mandarin ASR datasets show the replacement of RNNs by the self-attention networks yields a 8.4%-10.2% relative character error rate (CER) reduction. In addition, the chunk-hopping mechanism allows the SAA to have only a 2.5% relative CER degradation with a 320ms latency. After jointly training with a self-attention network language model, our SAA model obtains further error rate reduction on multiple datasets. Especially, it achieves 24.12% CER on the Mandarin ASR benchmark (HKUST), exceeding the best end-to-end model by over 2% absolute CER."}

Although some efforts based on syntactic analysis have opened the door to research in Quantum NLP (QNLP), limitations such as heavy syntactic preprocessing and syntax-dependent network architecture make them impracticable on larger and real-world data sets. In this paper, we propose a new simple network architecture, called the quantum self-attention neural network (QSANN), which can compensate for these limitations. Specifically, we introduce the self-attention mechanism into quantum neural networks and then utilize a Gaussian projected quantum self-attention serving as a sensible quantum version of self-attention. As a result, QSANN is effective and scalable on larger data sets and has the desirable property of being implementable on near-term quantum devices. In particular, our QSANN outperforms the best existing QNLP model based on syntactic analysis as well as a simple classical self-attention neural network in numerical experiments of text classification tasks on public data sets. We further show that our method exhibits robustness to low-level quantum noises and showcases resilience to quantum neural network architectures."}

{"id": "SEED_27", "title": "Causal Interpretation of Self-Attention in Pre-Trained Transformers", "abstract": "We propose a causal interpretation of self-attention in the Transformer neural network architecture. We interpret self-attention as a mechanism that estimates a structural equation model for a given input sequence of symbols (tokens). The structural equation model can be interpreted, in turn, as a causal structure over the input symbols under the specific context of the input sequence. Importantly, this interpretation remains valid in the presence of latent confounders. Following this interpretation, we estimate conditional independence relations between input symbols by calculating partial correlations between their corresponding representations in the deepest attention layer. This enables learning the causal structure over an input sequence using existing constraint-based algorithms. In this sense, existing pre-trained Transformers can be utilized for zero-shot causal-discovery. We demonstrate this method by providing causal explanations for the outcomes of Transformers in two tasks: sentiment classification (NLP) and recommendation."}

These limitations motivate researchers for the design of more efficient deep models. On the other hand, self-attention networks based on Transformer architecture have attracted remarkable interests due to their high parallelization capabilities and strong performance on a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. Inspired by the Transformer, we propose a tandem Self-Attention Encoding and Pooling (SAEP) mechanism to obtain a discriminative speaker embedding given non-fixed length speech utterances. SAEP is a stack of identical blocks solely relied on self-attention and position-wise feed-forward networks to create vector representation of speakers. This approach encodes short-term speaker spectral features into speaker embeddings to be used in text-independent speaker verification. We have evaluated this approach on both VoxCeleb1 & 2 datasets. The proposed architecture is able to outperform the baseline x-vector, and shows competitive performance to some other benchmarks based on convolutions, with a significant reduction in model size. It employs 94%, 95%, and 73% less parameters compared to ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and x-vector, respectively. This indicates that the proposed fully attention based architecture is more efficient in extracting time-invariant features from speaker utterances."}

However, existing deep models are mainly designed for the semantic matching between a pair of short texts, such as paraphrase identification and question answering, and do not perform well on the task of relevance matching between short-long text pairs. This is partially due to the fact that the essential characteristics of short-long text matching have not been well considered in these deep models. More specifically, these methods fail to handle extreme length discrepancy between text pieces and neither can they fully characterize the underlying structural information in long text documents. In this paper, we are especially interested in relevance matching between a piece of short text and a long document, which is critical to problems like query-document matching in information retrieval and web searching. To extract the structural information of documents, an undirected graph is constructed, with each vertex representing a keyword and the weight of an edge indicating the degree of interaction between keywords. Based on the keyword graph, we further propose a Multiresolution Graph Attention Network to learn multi-layered representations of vertices through a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and then match the short text snippet with the graphical representation of the document with the attention mechanisms applied over each layer of the GCN. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our graph approach outperforms other state-of-the-art deep matching models."}

Our loss can be applied to different attacking methods to boost their attack efficacy in terms of attack successful rates and poisoning rates. It applies to not only traditional dirty-label attacks, but also the more challenging clean-label attacks. We validate our method on different backbone models (BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT) and various tasks (Sentiment Analysis, Toxic Detection, and Topic Classification)."}
{"id": "SEED_32", "title": "You Only Sample (Almost) Once: Linear Cost Self-Attention Via Bernoulli Sampling", "abstract": "Transformer-based models are widely used in natural language processing (NLP). Central to the transformer model is the self-attention mechanism, which captures the interactions of token pairs in the input sequences and depends quadratically on the sequence length. Training such models on longer sequences is expensive. In this paper, we show that a Bernoulli sampling attention mechanism based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), decreases the quadratic complexity of such models to linear. We bypass the quadratic cost by considering self-attention as a sum of individual tokens associated with Bernoulli random variables that can, in principle, be sampled at once by a single hash (although in practice, this number may be a small constant). This leads to an efficient sampling scheme to estimate self-attention which relies on specific modifications of LSH (to enable deployment on GPU architectures). We evaluate our algorithm on the GLUE benchmark with standard 512 sequence length where we see favorable performance relative to a standard pretrained Transformer. On the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, for evaluating performance on long sequences, our method achieves results consistent with softmax self-attention but with sizable speed-ups and memory savings and often outperforms other efficient self-attention methods.

This task enables many potential applications such as question answering and paraphrase identification. This paper proposes Co-Stack Residual Affinity Networks (CSRAN), a new and universal neural architecture for this problem. CSRAN is a deep architecture, involving stacked (multi-layered) recurrent encoders. Stacked/Deep architectures are traditionally difficult to train, due to the inherent weaknesses such as difficulty with feature propagation and vanishing gradients. CSRAN incorporates two novel components to take advantage of the stacked architecture. Firstly, it introduces a new bidirectional alignment mechanism that learns affinity weights by fusing sequence pairs across stacked hierarchies. Secondly, it leverages a multi-level attention refinement component between stacked recurrent layers. The key intuition is that, by leveraging information across all network hierarchies, we can not only improve gradient flow but also improve overall performance. We conduct extensive experiments on six well-studied text sequence matching datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on all."}
{"id": "SEED_34", "title": "Hybrid Attention-Based Transformer Block Model for Distant Supervision Relation Extraction", "abstract": "With an exponential explosive growth of various digital text information, it is challenging to efficiently obtain specific knowledge from massive unstructured text information. As one basic task for natural language processing (NLP), relation extraction aims to extract the semantic relation between entity pairs based on the given text. To avoid manual labeling of datasets, distant supervision relation extraction (DSRE) has been widely used, aiming to utilize knowledge base to automatically annotate datasets. Unfortunately, this method heavily suffers from wrong labelling due to the underlying strong assumptions. To address this issue, we propose a new framework using hybrid attention-based Transformer block with multi-instance learning to perform the DSRE task. More specifically, the Transformer block is firstly used as the sentence encoder to capture syntactic information of sentences, which mainly utilizes multi-head self-attention to extract features from word level. Then, a more concise sentence-level attention mechanism is adopted to constitute the bag representation, aiming to incorporate valid information of each sentence to effectively represent the bag. Experimental results on the public dataset New York Times (NYT) demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms on the evaluation dataset, which verifies the effectiveness of our model for the DSRE task."}

Applying attention in next-frame and time series forecasting", "abstract": "Recurrent Neural Networks were, until recently, one of the best ways to capture the timely dependencies in sequences. However, with the introduction of the Transformer, it has been proven that an architecture with only attention-mechanisms without any RNN can improve on the results in various sequence processing tasks (e.g. NLP). Multiple studies since then have shown that similar approaches can be applied for images, point clouds, video, audio or time series forecasting. Furthermore, solutions such as the Perceiver or the Informer have been introduced to expand on the applicability of the Transformer. Our main objective is testing and evaluating the effectiveness of applying Transformer-like models on time series data, tackling susceptibility to anomalies, context awareness and space complexity by fine-tuning the hyperparameters, preprocessing the data, applying dimensionality reduction or convolutional encodings, etc. We are also looking at the problem of next-frame prediction and exploring ways to modify existing solutions in order to achieve higher performance and learn generalized knowledge."}

Recent research suggests the key may lie in multi-headed attention mechanism's ability to learn and represent linguistic information. Understanding how these models represent both syntactic and semantic knowledge is vital to investigate why they succeed and fail, what they have learned, and how they can improve. We present Dodrio, an open-source interactive visualization tool to help NLP researchers and practitioners analyze attention mechanisms in transformer-based models with linguistic knowledge. Dodrio tightly integrates an overview that summarizes the roles of different attention heads, and detailed views that help users compare attention weights with the syntactic structure and semantic information in the input text. To facilitate the visual comparison of attention weights and linguistic knowledge, Dodrio applies different graph visualization techniques to represent attention weights scalable to longer input text. Case studies highlight how Dodrio provides insights into understanding the attention mechanism in transformer-based models. Dodrio is available at https://poloclub.github.io/dodrio/."}
{"id": "SEED_37", "title": "Scheduled DropHead: A Regularization Method for Transformer Models", "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce DropHead, a structured dropout method specifically designed for regularizing the multi-head attention mechanism, which is a key component of transformer, a state-of-the-art model for various NLP tasks. In contrast to the conventional dropout mechanisms which randomly drop units or connections, the proposed DropHead is a structured dropout method. It drops entire attention-heads during training and It prevents the multi-head attention model from being dominated by a small portion of attention heads while also reduces the risk of overfitting the training data, thus making use of the multi-head attention mechanism more efficiently. Motivated by recent studies about the learning dynamic of the multi-head attention mechanism, we propose a specific dropout rate schedule to adaptively adjust the dropout rate of DropHead and achieve better regularization effect. Experimental results on both machine translation and text classification benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

Since these models are typically guided by a sequence of learned self attention mechanisms and may comprise undesired inductive biases, it is paramount to be able to explore what the attention has learned. While static analyses of these models lead to targeted insights, interactive tools are more dynamic and can help humans better gain an intuition for the model-internal reasoning process. We present exBERT, an interactive tool named after the popular BERT language model, that provides insights into the meaning of the contextual representations by matching a human-specified input to similar contexts in a large annotated dataset. By aggregating the annotations of the matching similar contexts, exBERT helps intuitively explain what each attention-head has learned."}

Specifically, we propose contextualized non-local neural networks (CN$^{\\textbf{3}}$), which can both dynamically construct a task-specific structure of a sentence and leverage rich local dependencies within a particular neighborhood.

{"id": "SEED_40", "title": "VL-InterpreT: An Interactive Visualization Tool for Interpreting Vision-Language Transformers", "abstract": "Breakthroughs in transformer-based models have revolutionized not only the NLP field, but also vision and multimodal systems. However, although visualization and interpretability tools have become available for NLP models, internal mechanisms of vision and multimodal transformers remain largely opaque. With the success of these transformers, it is increasingly critical to understand their inner workings, as unraveling these black-boxes will lead to more capable and trustworthy models. To contribute to this quest, we propose VL-InterpreT, which provides novel interactive visualizations for interpreting the attentions and hidden representations in multimodal transformers. VL-InterpreT is a task agnostic and integrated tool that (1) tracks a variety of statistics in attention heads throughout all layers for both vision and language components, (2) visualizes cross-modal and intra-modal attentions through easily readable heatmaps, and (3) plots the hidden representations of vision and language tokens as they pass through the transformer layers. In this paper, we demonstrate the functionalities of VL-InterpreT through the analysis of KD-VLP, an end-to-end pretraining vision-language multimodal transformer-based model, in the tasks of Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) and WebQA, two visual question answering benchmarks. Furthermore, we also present a few interesting findings about multimodal transformer behaviors that were learned through our tool."}

The attention mechanism in the Transformer architecture is a critical component of LLMs, as it allows the model to selectively focus on specific input parts. The softmax unit, which is a key part of the attention mechanism, normalizes the attention scores. Hence, the performance of LLMs in various NLP tasks depends significantly on the crucial role played by the attention mechanism with the softmax unit.   In-context learning, as one of the celebrated abilities of recent LLMs, is an important concept in querying LLMs such as ChatGPT. Without further parameter updates, Transformers can learn to predict based on few in-context examples. However, the reason why Transformers becomes in-context learners is not well understood. Recently, several works [ASA+22,GTLV22,ONR+22] have studied the in-context learning from a mathematical perspective based on a linear regression formulation $\\min_x\\| Ax - b \\|_2$, which show Transformers' capability of learning linear functions in context.   In this work, we study the in-context learning based on a softmax regression formulation $\\min_{x} \\| \\langle \\exp(Ax), {\\bf 1}_n \\rangle^{-1} \\exp(Ax) - b \\|_2$ of Transformer's attention mechanism. We show the upper bounds of the data transformations induced by a single self-attention layer and by gradient-descent on a $\\ell_2$ regression loss for softmax prediction function, which imply that when training self-attention-only Transformers for fundamental regression tasks, the models learned by gradient-descent and Transformers show great similarity."}

Learning latent representations of discourse is an attractive alternative to acquiring expensive labeled discourse data. Liu and Lapata (2018) propose a structured attention mechanism for text classification that derives a tree over a text, akin to an RST discourse tree. We examine this model in detail, and evaluate on additional discourse-relevant tasks and datasets, in order to assess whether the structured attention improves performance on the end task and whether it captures a text's discourse structure. We find the learned latent trees have little to no structure and instead focus on lexical cues; even after obtaining more structured trees with proposed model modifications, the trees are still far from capturing discourse structure when compared to discourse dependency trees from an existing discourse parser. Finally, ablation studies show the structured attention provides little benefit, sometimes even hurting performance."}

The transformer network architecture is completely based on attention mechanisms, and it outperforms sequence-to-sequence models in neural machine translation without recurrent and convolutional layers. Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion is a task of converting letters (grapheme sequence) to their pronunciations (phoneme sequence). It plays a significant role in text-to-speech (TTS) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. In this paper, we investigate the application of transformer architecture to G2P conversion and compare its performance with recurrent and convolutional neural network based approaches. Phoneme and word error rates are evaluated on the CMUDict dataset for US English and the NetTalk dataset. The results show that transformer based G2P outperforms the convolutional-based approach in terms of word error rate and our results significantly exceeded previous recurrent approaches (without attention) regarding word and phoneme error rates on both datasets. Furthermore, the size of the proposed model is much smaller than the size of the previous approaches."}

LLMs have shown great promise in improving the accuracy and efficiency of these tasks, and have the potential to revolutionize the field of natural language processing (NLP) in the years to come. Exponential function based attention unit is a fundamental element in LLMs. Several previous works have studied the convergence of exponential regression and softmax regression.   In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve a rescaled version of the slightly different formulation of the softmax regression problem that arises in attention mechanisms of large language models. Specifically, we consider minimizing the squared loss between a certain function, which can be either the exponential function, hyperbolic sine function, or hyperbolic cosine function, and its inner product with a target $n$-dimensional vector $b$, scaled by the normalization term. This ``rescaled softmax regression'' differs from classical softmax regression in the location of the normalization factor.   The efficiency and generalizability of this framework to multiple hyperbolic functions make it relevant for optimizing attention mechanisms. The analysis also leads to a corollary bounding solution changes under small perturbations for in-context learning. Limitations and societal impact are discussed."}

{"id": "SEED_46", "title": "BERT-GT: Cross-sentence n-ary relation extraction with BERT and Graph Transformer", "abstract": "A biomedical relation statement is commonly expressed in multiple sentences and consists of many concepts, including gene, disease, chemical, and mutation. To automatically extract information from biomedical literature, existing biomedical text-mining approaches typically formulate the problem as a cross-sentence n-ary relation-extraction task that detects relations among n entities across multiple sentences, and use either a graph neural network (GNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) or an attention mechanism. Recently, Transformer has been shown to outperform LSTM on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this work, we propose a novel architecture that combines Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers with Graph Transformer (BERT-GT), through integrating a neighbor-attention mechanism into the BERT architecture. Unlike the original Transformer architecture, which utilizes the whole sentence(s) to calculate the attention of the current token, the neighbor-attention mechanism in our method calculates its attention utilizing only its neighbor tokens. Thus, each token can pay attention to its neighbor information with little noise. We show that this is critically important when the text is very long, as in cross-sentence or abstract-level relation-extraction tasks. Our benchmarking results show improvements of 5.44% and 3.89% in accuracy and F1-measure over the state-of-the-art on n-ary and chemical-protein relation datasets, suggesting BERT-GT is a robust approach that is applicable to other biomedical relation extraction tasks or datasets."}

Most current pretraining methods, however, are limited to one or two modalities. We present i-Code, a self-supervised pretraining framework where users may flexibly combine the modalities of vision, speech, and language into unified and general-purpose vector representations. In this framework, data from each modality are first given to pretrained single-modality encoders. The encoder outputs are then integrated with a multimodal fusion network, which uses novel attention mechanisms and other architectural innovations to effectively combine information from the different modalities. The entire system is pretrained end-to-end with new objectives including masked modality unit modeling and cross-modality contrastive learning. Unlike previous research using only video for pretraining, the i-Code framework can dynamically process single, dual, and triple-modality data during training and inference, flexibly projecting different combinations of modalities into a single representation space. Experimental results demonstrate how i-Code can outperform state-of-the-art techniques on five video understanding tasks and the GLUE NLP benchmark, improving by as much as 11% and demonstrating the power of integrative multimodal pretraining."}

However, how do Transformers cope with the irregularity and unordered nature of point clouds? How suitable are Transformers for different 3D representations (e.g., point- or voxel-based)? How competent are Transformers for various 3D processing tasks? As of now, there is still no systematic survey of the research on these issues. For the first time, we provided a comprehensive overview of increasingly popular Transformers for 3D point cloud analysis. We start by introducing the theory of the Transformer architecture and reviewing its applications in 2D/3D fields. Then, we present three different taxonomies (i.e., implementation-, data representation-, and task-based), which can classify current Transformer-based methods from multiple perspectives. Furthermore, we present the results of an investigation of the variants and improvements of the self-attention mechanism in 3D. To demonstrate the superiority of Transformers in point cloud analysis, we present comprehensive comparisons of various Transformer-based methods for classification, segmentation, and object detection. Finally, we suggest three potential research directions, providing benefit references for the development of 3D Transformers."}

One of the key challenges of this problem is that when the events of interest are far away in text, the context in-between often becomes complicated, making it challenging to resolve the temporal relationship between them. This paper thus proposes a new Syntax-guided Graph Transformer network (SGT) to mitigate this issue, by (1) explicitly exploiting the connection between two events based on their dependency parsing trees, and (2) automatically locating temporal cues between two events via a novel syntax-guided attention mechanism. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, MATRES and TB-Dense, show that our approach significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on both end-to-end temporal relation extraction and temporal relation classification; This improvement also proves to be robust on the contrast set of MATRES.
